# Video Games Sales Project
My first public project! The data is from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/gregorut/videogamesales). The idea here is to play around with the data and apply pretty much everything I've learned so far. I'll be focusing on data reading and manipulation (and a bit of visualisation too) using **Pandas** and more visualisation using **Matplotlib**. **Numpy** and **Seaborn** will also come in handy; the former very briefly, the latter implicitely.
