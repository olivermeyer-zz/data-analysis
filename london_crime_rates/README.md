#London Crime Rates
Using open data from the (London Datastore)[https://data.london.gov.uk/], the aim of this project is to apply data preprocessing (cleaning and aggregation) and exploration (correlation and visualisation) techniques. I explore the relationship between crime rates, economic inactivity rates and children activity rates at the borough level in the city of London.
