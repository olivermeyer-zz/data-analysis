#London Crime Rates

**Themes: data cleaning, aggregation, manipulation and visualisation**

###Overview
Using open data from the [London Datastore](https://data.london.gov.uk/), the aim of this project is to apply data preprocessing (cleaning and aggregation) and exploration (correlation and visualisation) techniques. I explore the relationship between crime rates, economic inactivity rates and children activity rates at the borough level in the city of London.

###Process
I first explore each dataset briefly to determine what needs to be done before they can be merged (i.e. find levels of granularity, identify and solve missing values, convert columns to usable types). I then merge the DataFrames and proceed to exploring them, using high-level visualisation methods and correlation analysis.

###Key Findings
* Economic inactivity rates and crime rates are positively and significantly correlated;
* This relationship is consistent over the years;
* Percentage of children and crime rates are negatively and significantly correlated.
